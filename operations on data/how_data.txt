what's remaining:
- data of all players as batsmen, allr, and bowlers
- all matches dataset including their stadiums 


- now onwards:

normalization should be done in runs and balls.

- calculate effect of captain, as who is the most influential one,
with their winning percentages.



what data:
- country wise dataset win% on ground name
- country wise dataset win% against particular team
- country wise dataset win% with captains
