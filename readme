The folder contains several folders and the folders are named accordingly:
like the 'masterdatafiles' folder contains all the data sets our team created and which we are using
for our estimation or prediction, likewise 'operations on data' folder contains all the python or text files
that we used for creating our datasets, cleaning original data and manipulating them.
The static, templates files are the files containing the web code, the frontend part.
'masterWinCal.py' is the main python file where all the data manipulation, and calculation is happening 
at the last stage, through which we are getting the result of the game.
To run the program:
1. you need to open the 'gui_integrate.py' file and run it (we have used VS Code to create and run these files)
2. Once the program runs, in the terminal you get a link to a local webpage which indeed is our webapp.
3. Fill in all values, and then click the predict button to predict the outcome.
4. to finish or close the site, just enter 'ctrl + C' in the terminalm and the program terminates.
